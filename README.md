### Configuration TypeScript

This project uses TypeScript to improve type security and facilitate development. Follow these steps to configure the development environment.

1. TypeScript installation

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

2. Create tsconfig.json file
Create a tsconfig.json file in the project root with the following contents:

```json
Copy code
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

3. Transpile TypeScript
Run the build script to transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript.

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Linter and Code Formatter
Use ESLint with TypeScript and Prettier for code linting and formatting.

```bash
npm install eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin --save-dev
```

5. Type definitions
Configure TypeScript type definitions for third-party libraries.

6. Build and Linting scripts
Use the following scripts in the package.json file:

```json

"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc",
  "lint": "eslint src --fix"
}
```

7. Watch Mode
For continuous development, use watch mode.

```bash
npm run build:watch
```
